## Music Store DataBase Management System

This project implements a Java-based simulation of an online store using JDBC for database interaction. It features a client-server architecture where client requests are processed by a server which interacts with a relational database to manage user data and store inventory.

## Features
- `Client-Server Architecture`: Utilizes Java sockets for communication between clients and the server.
- `Role-Based Access`: Supports multiple user roles with different privileges, including admin and regular users.
- `Database Interactions`: Uses JDBC to handle all interactions with the MySQL database, executing SQL queries to manage users and transactions.

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or newer
- MySQL Server


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
